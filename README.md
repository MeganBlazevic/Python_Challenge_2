# Python_Challenge_2

In this assignment there were 2 different activities.

**PyBank**
This activity had you look at profit and losses each month and determine the greatest increase and decrease in activities.
It took me along while to have the greatest increase and decrease in profits work correctly. Most of my issue was that I was looking at the the profits not the change in values.
I felt like I had a lot of variables defined; and I'm sure that I could have done this easier. But I looked back at past lessons and cobbled together bits and pieces which made sense to me as I stepped through it. But as I talked through some issues wiht my dad, he just shook his head as I know its a bunch of random pieces that happened to work together. 

**PyPoll**
This activity had you look at vote countint for a town. And yuou had to detemine the nubmer of votes per candidate and the winner.
My biggest challenge on this one was to get the layout spacing correctly. Learning the \n to break apart to each own line.


Overall through these challenges I focused on trying to seperate ways to obtain the data. I wanted to try to make my brain think a bit differently and try different options, which had be using if and else and if and elifs.

Another challenge it took me a bit to determine was remembering how to add the new analysis file in the Analysis Folders within each activity.  Remembering in the open and write code lines to add a \ between the folder and the new file, automatically intserts it quickly.

I also was able to connect with my dad who taught me his trick and utilzing the camel code style of writing. It helped me to streamline my underscores and strung together words. I know that I need to also work on trying not to use some functional words ex. rows...as it will make reading my code easier.

I also had a lot of challenges getting my homework especially this readme file to commit to git. Thus the reason for this modules activities being Challenge_2.
